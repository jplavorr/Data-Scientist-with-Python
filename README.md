# Data Scientist with Python

In this repository I will start a series, based on Data Camp ['Data Scientist Carrer Track'](https://app.datacamp.com/learn/career-tracks/data-scientist-with-python?version=5) course. I will reproduce the content seen in the course using Python and drawing conclusions from the data.

In this track, you'll learn how this versatile language allows you to import, clean, manipulate, and visualize data—all integral skills for any aspiring data professional or researcher. Through interactive exercises, you'll get hands-on with some of the most popular Python libraries, including pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and many more. You'll then work with real-world datasets to learn the statistical and machine learning techniques you need to train decision trees and use natural language processing (NLP). Start this track, grow your Python skills, and begin your journey to becoming a confident data scientist.
